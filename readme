### type hints in python

A colon, indicates the start of a type hint for a variable
~~~
variable_name: <type> <initialization_value>
dog: str = "bob"
numerator: int = 12
~~~

An arrow indicates the start of a type hint for a function return type
~~~
def calculateSum(firstValue: float) -> float
def calculateDiff(seconds: int) -> int
def calculateProd(nanoSeconds: int) -> float
~~~

- they make code more readable and can be simply adjusted
~~~
def repeat(item: Any, times: int) -> List[Any]:

def repeat(item: float, times: int) -> List[float]
~~~

### NOTE:
    - type hints are simply hints and the program can completely ignore them at runtime.
