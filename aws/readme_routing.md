This SQL code snippet is using the unix_timestamp function to convert a timestamp value (ts) to the Unix epoch time. It concatenates the date part of the timestamp with the string '23:50:00' to represent the end of the day at 23:50:00. The resulting string is then passed to the unix_timestamp function to calculate the Unix epoch time in seconds since January 1, 1970. The result is aliased as ttl_epoch.
